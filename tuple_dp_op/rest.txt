He served me an Uni Hand roll , which I never had before , and let me tell youIT WAS HEAVEN ! .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To sum it up , Service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .####O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O

Come on .####O O O
Do n't get me started on the margaritas , either .####O O O O O O O O O O O
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
Really , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Maggot in the food !####O O O O O
I 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .####O O O O O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food , and made it seem like a big concession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O

This is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O
But $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include Wine ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Are you freaking kidding me ?####O O O O O O
Look , the appetizers were really good .####O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O
The entree was also very good .####O O O O O O O
Ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What you are paying for is the environment and the name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .####O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O

Drinks , 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $ 35 each .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
Starters , Kobe Beef Sashimi .####O O O O O O
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .####O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O B-POS O

The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say I 've been to the four seasons restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All in all , the food was great except for the dessserts .####O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O
If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , it is good , but I 've had better for cheaper .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O

I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .####O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O

And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .####O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The place is beautiful !####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
The hostess was very pleasant .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O
However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !####O O O O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O
Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O
Since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
Our experience did not ever get any better .####O O O O O O O O O
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We asked for beverages and never received them .####O O O O O O O O O
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####O B-NEU O B-OP-0 O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
I would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received ! .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
To top it all off the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-POS I-POS O
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I went here for a family birthday dinner .####O O O O O O O O O
Five of us walked in at approximately 6 , 20 on a Thursday evening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 B-POS O
There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O

I believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After we ate our appetizers which took all of 8 minutes we ordered another round of Brahma 's , and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
She replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
We called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .####O O O B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O
They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done my sister still had her fork in hand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All in all the food was good , a little on the expensive side , but fresh .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-1 O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O

Very normal Indian food , but done really well .####O O O B-POS O O O O O O
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just chicken tikka masala , no bread of rice , is $ 25 , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff more than the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
But if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O B-POS

For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .####O O O O O O O O O O
Fine , I wont hang you for that .####O O O O O O O O O
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-OP--1 O O O B-NEG O O O O
Not one to jump to complaints hence my lack of previous online reviewing , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O

Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####O B-NEG O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City####O O O O O O O O
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie that do n't serve sushi , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you 're no longer in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you 're planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you 'll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice .####O O O O O O O O O O
The sake's complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse interesting but not extraordinary and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-OP-0 O B-NEU B-OP-1 O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
Maybe it was the great company I had friends visiting from Philly , yes , it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca n't say enough good things about this brasserie .####O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
I do n't usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I 'll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O
Terrible would be a compliment !####O O O O O O
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday , we sat in the tent .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !####O O O O O O O O O O
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Great Shabu Shabu####O O O
I go here at least once every other week , particularly when it 's cold !####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O
To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu .####O O O O O O O O O O O
I tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
But for the Shabu Shabu , you wo n't find much better in NY .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In fact there is only one I 've tried that even compares shabu Tatsu and even then I prefer Dokebi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .####O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O B-POS O O O O O
The hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O

Just want to warn you all , do n't waste your time and money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls , I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs , mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional .####O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary .####O O O O O O O O O O
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n't like being cramp in a corner .####O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation if possible####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O
Loved it####O O
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O
The atmosphere was great .####O B-POS O O O
The food we ordered was excellent , although I would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .####O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
Maybe it has improved since then ?####O O O O O O O
Regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Polite acknowledgement is out ;####O B-POS O O O
supercilious scorn is in .####O O O O O
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer which was delicious .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .####O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On that scale , it 's a world-beater .####O O O O O O O O O
How is this palce still open ?####O O O O O O O
I honestly do n't even know where to begin .####O O O O O O O O O O
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .####O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-POS O O O O O
We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everything was going good until we got our meals .####O O O O O O O O O O
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O B-NEU O O O O B-NEU O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .####O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've had better chicken at BBQs ! ! ! !####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier No apology , nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is where it really really gets bad , the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The level of rudeness was preposterous .####O B-NEG I-NEG I-NEG O B-OP--1 O
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The frizzy retro girl with winged/ Dame Edna glasses will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in , except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So rude ! ! !####O O O O O
I went with JWILS .####O O O O O
Her review is above .####O O O O O
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
My friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .####O O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , can I help you and how many are in your party .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What ?####O O
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .####O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-NEG I-NEG I-NEG O
bad staff####B-OP--1 B-NEG
I generally like this place .####O O O O O O
The food is good .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
The design of the space is good .####O B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O
But the service is HORRID !####O O B-NEG O O O
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
