I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O
I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O
The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team , which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
I investigated netbooks and saw the Toshiba NB305-N410BL .####O O O O O O O O O
The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .####O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is of high quality , has a killer GUI , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .####O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
Sad very SAD .####O O O O
I even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , iChat , Photobooth , garage band and more !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Needless to say a PC that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O
Great laptop that offers many great features !####O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-1 B-NEU O
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-POS B-NEG B-OP-1 O B-OP--1 O B-NEG B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O
Still pretty pricey , but I 've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O
I took it back for an Asus and same thing blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O
In the shop , these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure , so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it very clever con .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
However , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you 're gaming .####O O O B-NEG I-NEG O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU B-OP--1 O O O O O
Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I HATE this one .####O O O O O
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oh , boy !####O O O O
But while this is one big advantage as you may know from the company s recent commercials there are other things to consider before going with Apple .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
I love the way the entire suite of software works together .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O
on the bright side at least I was n't without my laptop for long this time !####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great !####O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's how frustrating it was .####O O O O O O O
I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but thats the only bad thing about this computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O
-No backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .####O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ca n't even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O
One suggestion I do have , is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure , talk about painless syncing , used to take me forever , now it 's a snap .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I shopped around before buying .####O O O O O O
I also got the added bonus of a 30" HD Monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS B-OP-1 O
Would do business again .####O O O O O
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .####O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O
After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have had the luxury sarcasm of owning 2 of these laptops .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What a waste .####O O O O
It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat .####O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O
There are a few flaws as well that I noticed .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O
Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .####O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O B-NEU O
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
I did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, In the past four years I 've had it I have never once gotten a virus .####O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I love the operating system and the preloaded software .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
They were great in handling this problem , and I 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O
I 've tried going back to XL but there still problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .####O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
After numerous attempts of trying including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly , I gave upI am a techie .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

but now i have realized its a problem with this brand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
It can not save the correct date and time I set .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And this is n't just my one experine .####O O O O O O O O O
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O B-NEG I-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O
I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would highly recommend this one to my friends####O O O O O O O O O
I honestly love my mac , thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also kinda loud when the fan was running .####O O O O O O O O O
In desparation , I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired 2 days old and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me have your credit card ready .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS I-POS B-OP-1 O
I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O B-NEG O B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-they lost my laptop for a month####O O O O O O O
Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support .####O O O O O O O O O O
This is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first !####O O O
Speaking of the browser , it too has problems .####O O O O O O O O O O
I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I ca n't imagine ever going back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The keyboard is too slick .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O
Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .####O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's like 9 punds , but if you can look past it , it 's GREAT !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O B-OP-0 O
Still under warrenty so called Toshiba , no help at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I LOVE IT !####O O O O
Amazing Quality !####O O O
The fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files pics , vids , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O
A month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
The system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O
I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
*2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is on the top of the stack .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This machine delivers .####O O O O
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I complain again .####O O O O
This laptop is insane ! ! !####O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O
If a website ever freezes which is rare , its really easy to force quit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
what an elegant , wonderful machine .####O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 B-POS O
This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for 2 months .####O O O O
I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do you ever think HP would do that ? NEVER !####O O O O O O O O O O O
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Still trying to learn how to use it .####O O O O O O O O O
The reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my Documents folder .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O
I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 O O O O O O
The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We 'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thank you for your great product !####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sorry Toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####O O O O O B-NEG O O O O O
Then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Overall this laptop is great .####O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
I love the glass touchpad .####O O O O O O
I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-NEG I-NEG O O O
I am using the external speaker sound is good .####O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O

As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I wo n't have to worry about a crash .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O
Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP .####O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O

And if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar can not be beat .####O B-POS O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I shipped out on Saturday , July 17 .####O O O O O O O O O

I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .####O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid , mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I recommend for word processing and internet users .####O O O O O O O O O
Since I 've had this computer I 've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more , they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .####O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That system is fixed .####O O O O O
The computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One of the smartest thing I did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Like the price and operation .####O O O O O O
The brand is tarnished in my heart .####O O O O O O O O
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and I 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but I still expected better product quality for this price range .####O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O

It runs very quiet too which is a plus .####O O O O O O O O O O

After sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , I broke down and spent another $ 100 to get Microsoft Word for Mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe I purchased this in Dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only bad part is the size .####O B-OP-0 B-OP--1 B-NEU O O O O
The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I liked the aluminum body .####O O O O O O
also it is light weight compared to others .####O O O O B-POS O O O O
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
From the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O

I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Buy it , love it , and I promise you wo n't regret it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I needed a driver for my HP and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Call tech support , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .####O O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
Just a month and a half or two months ago , my VAIO crashed again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A coupla months later , they change my hard drive .####O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am .####O O O O O O O O O O O
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .####O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O

I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O
I own other Macs but always find myself navigation to the MacBook Pro to get my work done .####O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
The love part of my relationship with this laptop does n't take very long .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O
The screen shows great colors .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's a huge difference .####O O O B-OP-0 O O
Dells are ok , HPs are n't that good , but Macs or Fantastic .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O
So , buyers beware !####O O O O O
I am totally satisfied with my little toshie !####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
I have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam , just for starters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Again , I sent it off to Acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DEFINITELY recommended ! ! !####O O O O O
It is extremely user friendly and intuitive .####O O O B-POS B-OP-1 O O O
Let me start with the good , So awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O
I had finally reached my limit and broke down .####O O O O O O O O O O
The 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .####O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O
My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible support , but this machine just caused another plunge .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O
Do I like the computer ? Well , other than not getting viruses , I guess it is OK .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For the Bluetooth to work properly , you must install the Launch Manager on the Drivers/Applications DVD , or it will not show after the reload .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I waited and waited and no laptop .####O O O O O O O O
Everything is falling apart internally and externally .####O O O O O O O O
I also liked the glass screen .####O O O O O O O
The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O
It super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they CA N'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its a dog plain and simple .####O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 O
When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
My HP is very heavy .####O O O O B-OP--1 O
I bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months If it is overload with updates the BOOT MGR .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .####O O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The price and features more than met my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O
They refuse .####O O O
big mistake !####B-OP-0 B-NEU O
Best Buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so I can place it there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and I would n't have the same problems because it was updated .####O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O

I can actually get work done with this MAC , and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-OP-0 O B-NEU O
Also , HDD secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-OP--1 B-NEG O
If you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just do n't waste your time and money on this .####O O O O O O O O O O O
All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP--1 O O O O B-NEG O O O O O O O
Beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Other Thoughts , Do not purchase this product .####O O O O O O O O O
They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive I do n't really understand why but anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O

Long story short , since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one , I did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .####O B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-POS O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-POS O O B-POS O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O

I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP , but I use the touchpad 90 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Probbly the worst decision we ever made !####O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O

This computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and I DO mean crawling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I had less problems .####O O O O O

I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O B-POS O
That was a big mistake .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
Small enough to use on a long flight , Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O
Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The processor went on me , the fan went and the motherboard went .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Might not make the avid gamer happy but I do n't really think that is what this computer is designed for .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for .####O O O O O O O O O O O
Even though it is running Snow Leopard , 24 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .####O O O O O O O O O O O

I have never had an experience like this .####O O O O O O O O O
We have n't had any problems with it at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O

Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund .####O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O
First of all , they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I 'd paid almost $ 400 for , and I had to call in , spend hours on their online chat service , and fax in multiple documents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O O O O B-OP-0 O O

Such as PAGES , NUMBERS , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O

the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one , but IMO NO STARS####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service .####O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG I-NEG O
They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-POS O O O O O O
The machine itself is alright .####O O O O B-OP-0 O
It seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like I thought they would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I do n't run accross a situation like this again !####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again !####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tons of bloatware and junk programs .####O O O O O O O
its sad because their commercials are great .####O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .####O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O
Luckily , Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead I got a refund and bought a mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Never been hacked .####O O O O
It 's so bad that I 'm thinking I only got half a battery or something .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7 .####O B-POS O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-POS O O
I think it was seventy nine plus tax .####O O O O O O O O O
In summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications .####O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I will NEVER buy Refurbished again , I do n't cae how cheap it is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is just slow slow slow .####O O O O O O O
Bottom line , I doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As a lifelong Windows user , I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac .####O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , owing to these problems , I went out and got myself an Apple MacBook Pro , which I am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop .####O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O
So this was great for me .####O O O O O O O
This is the first macbook I have ever had .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
The acer one compuer is a great computer .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

So , if you 're thinking of a laptop , I would heartily recommend theApple 133 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer Z0J80001 Notebook for all your needs ! .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .####O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O
I picked it out becaASPECT0 it was inexpensive $ 400 and I thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG THE PRODUCT KEY .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Time remaining goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O O O O O O O O
Stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then I found it can only be loaded with 2GB *maximum* .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It also does not have bluetooth .####O O O O O O O
Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O
I can do pretty much 75 % of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Being a PC user my whole life .####O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
great battery life .####B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Delivery was early too .####O O O O O
During that time , I had to send it back 3 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O
Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O
And that probably explains why I 've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I left the place angrily .####O O O O O O
I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well !####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
I 've had a Toshiba laptop in the past ;####O O O O O O O O O O
It 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing .####O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O B-OP--1 O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O
ASUS said my net-book was working properly .####O O O O O O O O
I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Very annoying .####O O O
My main reason to convert was the imovie program .####O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O
It has a faster processor and more ram .####O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 B-POS O
If you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .####O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O O O O O O O
Laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was n't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
It may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !####O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O
Would like more trendy , high tech features .####O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable .####O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-0 O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O B-OP-1 O
Screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O B-OP--1 O
Received the product promptly and without any issues .####O O O O O O O O O
It is so great , I can Hardly ever take my hands off it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But reasons we chose this Apple computer .####O O O O O O O O
Processor , When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance 23 GHz v/s 24 GHz .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They say it could be the motherboard again , but Dell####O O O O O O O O O O O
I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
2nd Best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into####O O B-POS O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Love the speed , especially !####O O O O O O
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac , the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior .####O O O O B-POS O O B-POS B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O
By Air sounds more like by truck to Me .####O O O O O O O O O O
So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's outstanding too .####O O O O O
The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you sowish .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
So I 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A MONTH LATER , we reinstall the OS (Vista) .####O O O O O O O O O O
Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarentee .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O
My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration - it 's a lie .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just chill and enjoy .####O O O O O
The battery life is also relatively good .####O B-POS I-POS O O O B-OP-1 O
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
I should have sent it back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC 's .####O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This laptop leaves alot to be desired , I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have found it very easy to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O
I do n't have stupid pop up windows even when I have pop ups blocked , I do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down .####O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
Do n't waste your money or time .####O O O O O O O O
It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS I-POS I-POS O O O O O O O
Memory is upgradable .####O O B-OP-1 O
Web access through the 3G network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING .####O B-NEG O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O
Well , I bought this laptop a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
Received all four in good order ;####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this is starting off good .####O O O O O O
The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite .####O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
Moral of the story , -Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
Very small and portable I 've had this netbook about 12 hrs now and It 's better than expected .####O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O B-NEU O O O
NOT WITH APPLE .####O O O O
After 3 pleasant weeks of use , the laptop just died .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O
Each time taking about 1 day or so .####O O O O O O O O O
Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one .####O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to applecom and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
So a couple of years later , I was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
This netbook went bad on me after 3 days .####O O O O O O O O O O
Probably wo n't work either .####O O O O O O
Great product by Apple with the new great looking design .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 O B-POS O
I love the keyboard .####O O O O O
Probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .####O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP--1 B-NEG O
Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O O O O O O
In my line of work , I often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They told me to reprogram the computer , and I did n't need to do that , and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography , amateurs and experts alike .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It took so much time .####O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
I hate it .####O O O O
The screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV .####O B-NEU O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'll stick to Tashiba .####O O O O O O
I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You will not regret buying such a great thing like this !####O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-OP-1 B-NEU O O O
I was said it 's videocard .####O O O O O O O
Plus stylish .####O O O
For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And , if you are going to deal with HP be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if you want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this computer .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My MacBook Pro is no exception .####O O O O O O O
Unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You may be reading one now !####O O O O O O O
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
In fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the first Apple product that I have purchased .####O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O
Now , as easy as it is to use , and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
Enough said .####O O O
Setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .####O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ever since I bought this laptop , so far I 've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU I-NEU O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do not plan on going back .####O O O O O O O O
No laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I really like the Mac 154in Notebook , but its very pricey .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .####O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O
iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .####O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O
We were occasional Mac users before , but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford .####O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Called tech support and got the usual Acer We do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you I explained there was no software involved in booting .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would never tell anyone to buy one either .####O O O O O O O O O O
The programs are great , like iphoto love the editing capabilities , imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad , imovie , etc .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only thing I did n't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ca n't say enough good for it !####O O O O O O O O O
Comfterbale to use light easy to transport .####O O O O O O O O
The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
I thought the price was great for the specs .####O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O
I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
So , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .####O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O O O O
Just for a stupid CD .####O O O B-OP--1 O O
Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It crashes , and when it goes flat , it just DIES like a PC , maybe worse and I loose all my open documents !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O
I am now making a point to avoid their products and I hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook - of course a different brand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !####O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O
When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Then I proceed to tell her that I checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't LIKE THAT .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only downfall is the volume control .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
Clearly , there is something wrong with the product and LG did n't take up the responsibility .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Very fast boot up and shut down .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
Right out of the box , this little netbook did everything I asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O
I am very happy with this laptop .####O O O O O O O O
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
What a mistake !####O O O O
If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a USB wireless card .####O B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
I had read online that some users were having sound problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
My last computer , a Toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
It discharges too quickly .####O O O O O
But to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time .####O O O O O O O B-NEU O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
three years is a decent life , but this must make it to graduation and beyond .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM .####O O O O O O O
Then it ceased charging at all .####O O O O O O O
An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-1 O O
I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O
*-ASPECT0 is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####O O O O O O O O O O

Stay away from HP .####O O O O O
The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I like it !####O O O O
The pricing is very competitive .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O

This computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prior to this computer , I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years quite a long time for a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
Maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The advantages of owning a mac are numerous .####O B-NEU O O O O O B-OP-0 O
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 25 hrs out of it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O
Using this machine is like a mild form of torture .####O O O O O O O O O O O
This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
On the twelfth day that I had the notebook , I decided to go to Dell 's website and update it .####O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The computer blinks it shuts off at will .####O O O O O O O O O
Excellent product for the money .####O B-POS O O O O

I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i do n't want it too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O
For those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
Despite the plethora of problems , I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O
I had my IWORKS , Itunes , Email , MS Office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Simply amazing computer ! !####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O
I first purchased this Dell model 1764 on April 6 , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O
The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two times with in one month .####O O O O O O O
The only downfall is a lot of the software I have wo n't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened 7 months ago they offered me an ITouch 8Gig you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows or Winblows , as I like ot call it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BUT there 's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
I hope to edit this in the next few hours , I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7 .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O
If it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a Friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
I also purchased Applecare for $ 300 , which is a three year extended warranty , since I ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it , I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
I run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs I do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
C'mon , LG .####O O O O
Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem , they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I 'd like to purchase more memory for $ 75 .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .####O O O O O B-OP--1 O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
If you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Registration/1st use is easy .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
I love this laptop , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Toshiba Mini Notebook , Model NB 305-N410BL , is a great little computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-0 B-NEU O
Take your time and go through the tutorials patiently .####O O O O O O O O O O
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm an excellent touch typist , and my hands are very sensitive , too .####O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O
This time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !####O O O B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O
EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .####O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
I bought a cordless mouse for it , but do n't always take it out ;####O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O
When I got it , I immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-OP--1 O O O O O
It is sleek , smooth , and lightweight .####O O B-OP-1 O O O O B-OP-1 O
i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing .####O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .####O O O O O O B-NEU O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
They only stay charged a little over an hour .####O O O O O O O O O O
Now they are believers in the product .####O O O O O O O O
Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O
Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought .####O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O
I had never owned a Mac before ;####O O O O O O O O
The 4 USB ports are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .####O O O B-NEU O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O
i try to use it today and I ca n't logon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
Keyboard could use some trimming .####O O O O O O
The bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .####O O O O O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O O
I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O
When I am next to my router on my HP I get full service , on my Eee PC I get 3 bars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Pretty disappointed about this product .####O O O O O O
The letter A stopped working after the first week .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student , so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It out performs any other laptop on the market today .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
This is what I call a good after sales service .####O O O O O O O O O O O
Maybe it 's Acer , maybe it 's MSFT .####O O O O O O O O O O
So if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one , if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands Best Buy sells .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-1 B-NEU O O O O
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With what I do know how to do , the computer works beautiful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I 'm going back to DELL .####O O O O O O O
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .####O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke .####O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O

Not a bad laptop , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O B-NEG B-OP--1 O O O O O O O
Honestly , I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for !####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This a starter notebook .####O O O O O
No I am generous calling it slow .####O O O O O O O O
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook , screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .####O B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O

All-in-all , I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .####O O O O O O O O O O O
The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphone , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
For the [ $ ] price special offer this is a great laptop .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

I called back to ensure that received it , they had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .####O O O O O O O O O O
What I 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
If you can afford a new laptop , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The battery life is great .####O B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O
This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;####O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O B-OP-0 O O O
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if , since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it 's like new , I might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O B-NEU O O O O O O B-NEU O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O

I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great pick for portability and affordability .####O B-POS O O O O O

We used PC products , it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O

I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba !####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
I take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O O O O O O O O
I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what I 've done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me even after installing new browsers then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-NEU O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
Now I could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !####O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O
I would definitely not go back to using a PC after using the mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the first laptop I 've owned , althougth I used several at my previous job .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall ? Yeah , I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Charger seems large for this class of computer .####O O O O O O O O O
I do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
I 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers .####O O O O O O O O O O O
The screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness are great .####O B-POS I-POS O B-POS O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O
So I called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I claim that this has no value to me , the laptop was new anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O
Enough said .####O O O
Not working = bad####O O O O
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O
My son said it popped up and he clicked update .####O O O O O O O O O O O
I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The unibody design is edgy and durable .####O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 O
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But , for the cost this is a winner .####O O O O O O O O O O
Let me tell you , this machine is great .####O O O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , the battery does not last very long at all .####O O O B-NEU O O B-OP-0 O O O O O
Good luck with your purchase options .####O B-POS O O O O O
Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
Very disappointed !####O O O
They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I bought it from HSN because it was bundled with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O B-NEG O O O O O O
I looked around and based off my price comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very use for designers .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O

That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .####O O O O O O O O O O
More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O O O O O O
No viruses .####O O O
It is everything that I would want in a computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O
Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O
However , If I sound enthusiastic about this , I am !####O O O O O O O O O O O O

i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They removed them and returned the computer to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
On 3 July 2004 , I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $ 150####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The ease of use is wonderful .####O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O
This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter .####O O O O O O O O O
-When battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair 26th of August .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The battery gets so HOT it is scary .####O O O O O O O O O
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs .####O B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
It 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding .####O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O
It 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
Mom , Dad , Brother , sister , You name it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Before , I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer 's site .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O
After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP--1 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O
So far , a great product .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

So I 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? The darn thing would n't go back on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O
Also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
They sent out a Sony 'Certified' technician .####O O O O O O O O
They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####O O O B-OP-1 B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .####O O O O O O O O O

As a die-hard Windows enthusiast , I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I had a MacBook Notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
Its Office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .####O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O B-NEU O
I occassionaly use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Do you think I purposely destroy my netbook , so that I can demand a new set ? Do you think it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution ?

I 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it that 's about how long the port seems to last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I had of course bought a 3 year warranty , so I sent it in to be replaced and almost 2 months later the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite the claims of the Apple apologists a vice of which I am recently myself reformed the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs at this point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O
Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Asus facial recognition does n't work and windows logon is n't either .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .####O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O
I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O B-NEU O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .####O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Otherwise , all other features are a 1####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
So in late March , early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .####O O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS I-POS O O O
The performance is awesome .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
I pondered very long over this decision .####O O O O O O O O
This thing sucks !####O O O O
I Love my new computer !####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
Okay , let 's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was a Waste of money from day one !####O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm new , just switched from years of PC frustration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I got another netbook which I love !####O O O O O O O O O
But in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
The display is beyond horrible .####O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O
He LEFT ME , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's a joke .####O O O O O
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
Actually , I had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I started hainv problems with it within the first month .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
Next , most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .####O O B-OP-0 O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop preformed pretty well .####O O B-OP-0 O O O
I 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I do n't see it as a problem .####O O O O O O O O O O
Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP .####O B-NEU O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O
This one has had the same effect .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This computer is absolutely AMAZING ! ! !####O O O O O O O O
So buyer beware when buying Toshiba####O O O O O O
I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
I love the Apple products .####O O O O O O
I loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows OS until this started happening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O
I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the Mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
Theres also iDVD , a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-POS O B-POS O B-POS O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O
His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test , and it was failing .####O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working 3 months of use which was frustrating .####O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have used PC 's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I love the easy to see screen , and It works well for work , persoal or just play .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If what you need is a machine to do some surfing , email checking , word processing , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-Apparently , contactus @ euroapplecom is not a good address to send complaints .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
It does n't have a lot of frills , but I did n't need any , and being able to buy what I needed , and not more than I needed was very important .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i 've ever seen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am sorry that I purchased this laptop .####O O O O O O O O O
Awesome graphics !####O B-POS O
It really is perfect for work and play .####O O O O O O O O O
The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edge hurt my wrists .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-POS O O O O
I am a college student and it has been very useful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made .####O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O
My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB .####O O O O O O B-NEU O O O
The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .####O B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I needed a new computer for graduate school had never owned a laptop before , and the only reason I did n't purchase a Mac was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have had another Mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O
If you have the money I suggest going for the i7 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's very possible , but since they do n't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine , I was stuck until Windows 7 came out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features I need .####O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is , however , very heavy .####O O O O O O O O
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O
Well , I started using Google Chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also the speakers are not very loud , But it is a netbook .####O O B-NEG O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O
LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET !####O O O O O O O O O O
But , at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just a black screen !####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
All you have to do is turn it on and it works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect .####O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
Eventually my battery would n't charge , so unless I had it plugged in it would n't even power on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Purchased for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing , e-mail , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .####O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
I had a USB connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Accordingly , I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product my five year old Compaq lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O
I ordered four D620 laptops .####O O O O O O
I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny besides , there 's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I saw this one , and I have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , I hate putting this computer down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
I love the multi-touch trackpad .####O O O O O O
I was psyched .####O O O O
I absolutely love my mac !####O O O O O O
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HP is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing .####O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-POS B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O
It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not too much junk software to remove .####O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O
System is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is easy to use , good quality and good price .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only issue is that it is a little slow , and I 'm fixing that by adding more RAM .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O
It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If I have a few hundred dollars to spare , I 'd buy the Pro line though , the 253 and 266 GHz model .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord .####O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O
But enough about that , I am an Apple convert for life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But , Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy .####O O O O O B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O
Another issue I have with it is the battery .####O O O O O O O O O O

PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ca n't begin to say how disappointed I am .####O O O O O O O O O O O
I get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you ca n't see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O B-OP-0 O O O
They offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like Toshiba .####O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O

I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also the display is exceptional !####O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O
The computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is basically the best laptop I have ever had or used .####O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O

The first one I had was a 2006 model , not the Pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
THEN , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .####O O B-NEU O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O B-OP-1 O
I normally do n't participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the blue screen of death .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
At first when I got this product , I loved it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think this computer is super lame .####O O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O
It had a seventeen inch screen which I wanted , but I did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O
Even doing so , the hinge may just be slightly tightened only .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .####O O B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O
The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services .####O B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O

The apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas .####O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O
pros , the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .####O O O O O B-NEU O O B-OP--1 B-NEG I-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I highly recommend this product !####O O O O O O
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP-1 B-POS
So far , it 's an average laptop , no better , no worse than the HP I replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .####O B-OP-0 B-OP--1 B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-POS B-OP-1 O

THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !####O O O O O

I was starting to boil .####O O O O O O
Hmmm , that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .####O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS B-OP-0 O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
BAck she goes !####O O O O
It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not the day received .####O O O O O
Good for every day computing and web browsing .####O O O O O O O O O
While lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Excellent LED monitor and well equipped .####O O O O O O O
This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O B-NEG O
Without a doubt , the *ASPECT0* of this laptop is fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O

Took a while to clean it up to my specs .####O O O O O O O O O O O
They are so realistic I am just speechless .####O O O O O O O O O
Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O
This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , I find not much difference except of course for the screen size .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O
But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O
There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have more problems then a 1980 's computer .####O O O O O O O O O O
It is amazing .####O O O O
Needless to say , not to happy with the product .####O O O O O O O O O O O
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O
Still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .####O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .####O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O

The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O

I did not have to call the support line at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7 .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly .####O B-OP-0 O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O
But if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba .####O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O
Do n't waste your money !####O O O O O O
Currently if I use the laptop I ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely .####O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O
Once again , I was told it was the suspicious power supply problem .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O B-NEG O
It easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Macbook starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light I have the 133 model , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O B-NEU O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact , and I am certainly glad I did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unable to boot up this brand new laptop .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
In addition , all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd drive twice , then they FINALLY agreed to replace it , ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS !####O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O B-NEG I-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I really do n't like it , but I am stuck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam .####O O O O O O
Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These new problems were the final straws ;####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
luckly i had a student task force able to help , or else it would have crashed within the first year .####O O O O B-POS I-POS I-POS B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O

Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O
Winters is on it 's way and I imagine it will be cozy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now the machine wo n't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I 'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O B-NEU O O O O O O
Will certainly use MacConnection again .####O O O O O O
But , buy this model and just purchase 4GB of RAM 2x2GB for $ 92 or 1x4GB for $ 99 , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8GB of RAM .####O O O O B-NEU O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
this is one of the reasons I purchased it .####O O O O O O O O O O
Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba , I went with an Asus G73JH-x3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She told me flatly , It 's like that one .####O O O O O O O O O O O
If you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is the easiest computer I have ever used####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
So you might ask , what did Apple do for me ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O
Browsing , also , was no problem for me when I used itunes which usually slows down my PC .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Again , decent comp for the price , and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Quality Display I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily .####O B-POS I-POS O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O

There 's literally no way to make it sing with Vista .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
After looking at all the pros and cons , I decided on the Macbook Pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
First , it does not have a push button to open the lid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
