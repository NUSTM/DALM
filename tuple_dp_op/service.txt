E*TRADE site is well thought out and contains truly all the information one needs to day trade , invest in mutuals , bonds or simply have a checking account with a good money marketing interest rate ( varies from 4 to 6% but still beats any non interest checking:- ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O

Well , after a year of trading I must say that I have been very disappointed with the service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I would think that it is hard to manage a school with so many students all over the world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O
Yahoo demands that to access the list management sections of our groups we owners must take on a new Yahoo ID . . . like they can't do as egroups has always done- accept our email addy and password for login .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , there were mistakes in the documents , and E*trade informed us at the closing that we needed a cashier's check for an amount that hadn't been previously disclosed to us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Secondly , and more seriously , E-trade attempts to pick your pocket when you trade " penny " stocks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
UOP is NOT perfect - we had a couple professors that were not great ( most of our professors were very good , with relevant , current field experience ) , and my financial aid counselors DID change constantly .####O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-OP-1 O B-NEU O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O

Bottom line is that I have been very disappointed with ETRADE .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have spent hours on the phone trying to resolve issues that proper site testing could have prevented ; in every case , the issues were clearly visible to the customer service reps , who were helpless to fix them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Being in a egroup is great sometimes , but you have to be willing to spend some extra time , cause you will get email notifications in your mail and then you have to read and rate those reviews that are sent too you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

UMUC is also taking flak because their teachers are older , out-of-touch with developments in their field of instruction , not representing the diversity of the student population UMUC serves and unable to find work at other colleges ( which is why they're at UMUC ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O

And on top of that , I plan on getting my PhD in Biomedical Engineering , and apparently DeVry isn't considered a valid school for that degree , so if you want to go somewhere else to receive a higher degree , you have to start from scratch .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O

I have not had any major problems with ET .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
I highly do NOT recommend UOP .####O O O O O O O
Something that I have learned about these people with pessimism towards Capella is that they are on tilt , have had their " wittle " feelings hurt by the process , or just are down right mad/ jealous that there are other options than the traditional B and M route ( of which my BS and MS are from B and M schools ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-OP-0 O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

It has taken us several months to refinance through E*trade , when typically it should have taken weeks .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , on heavy volume days there have been problems trading which is unforgivable and can crush the investor in a correction ( this has been better recently but don't give up your full-service account ) .####O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The features are great ( I will go into depth later ) , and they allow a low Minimum Initial Investment ( the Epinions page says $1000 , but the minimum for me was $500 ) .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

* Original content : there are definitely some good ideas to be found in their original content areas####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O B-OP-1 O O
Capella is a great program with rigorous format .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP-1 B-POS O
The courses were easy and professors quite good , but the support staff is very weak once they have you enrolled .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O
E*trade allowed $5894.95 to " Slip through the cracks . "####O O O O O O O O O O O
The professors are not only your instructors .####O O O O O O O O
I have wonderful classmates that are actively involved , great instructors ... for instance , one of my instructors had worked for NASA and one had worked for CIA several years before !####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O
One constant is that Etrade has been slow loading , ( which is why I've wanted to get DSL )####O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
UMUC-ED may not live up to my previous institutions academic standards , but you know what , I think to think that you get what you give .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The class sizes are small to medium , and the material covered is practical and relevant .####O B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-OP-0 O
All in all , when it comes to online communities , this is a highly recommended site .####O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O O O O O O O O
Also , if you are a short-medium term trader , main advantage to having an Etrade account are its Powertrade features .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O
To be honest , Egroups ( onelist ) was my first mailing list choice , and I haven't even bothered to look into other services .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
I found the staff and the professors bending over backwards to help you be successful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Etrade in my opinion clearly distinguishes itself from other online brokers such as Ameritrade , Scottrade or Suretrade because of its commitments to serious investors and its wide sources of information for the average investor .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-NEU O
The recent merger of eGroups and ONElist has created a much better service than was available before .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
When I've called customer service , they invariably suggest I'm making some type of mistake .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
E-Trade sent my bank a duplicate , unauthorized request to withdraw an extremely large sum of money from my account and then deposited my money into somebody else's E-Trade account .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

My advisor was horrible , she told me what classes I needed and it turned out I did not need the classes .####O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Egroups seems the best for now . . .####O O O O O O O O O
Their trade confirms are prompt and their " My Portfolio " provides a great way to customize the way you follow your holdings .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-POS O O O O O
When there are polls , they're easy to take part in as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My first group is very helpful to me when it comes to dealing with my medical problems .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O
But , it's still nice to have research in the same place as your portfolio .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
So one of the best things is that people can subscribe and unsubscribe and read the mail from the list in two ways : by email or at the egroups website .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The final advantage I've seen from E*Trade is that they really want to get my money , and they're willing to make it worthwhile .####O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The point is , if you've got an interest , you'll likely find a group for it at eGroups .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Capella is a junk degree sold to a disenfranchised group who are looking for a Ph D in all the wrong places .####O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
The other group that I just recently joined is alot nicer to be in , in my opinion that is !####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Displaying this information to the public is totally optional !####O O O O O O O O O O
Paypal's phone help told me there was nothing they could do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sometimes I think they have these tests so that students flunk and then have to pay to take the course again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I not only benefit from the information but , so does the whole group .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
It has a organized portfolio page .####O O O O O O O
However if you like research tools , ET doesn't really offer much .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
E-Trade frequently offers special promotions , to get investors to open up an account with them .####O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O

As a final note , I have to mention how good the E*Trade customer service is .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
