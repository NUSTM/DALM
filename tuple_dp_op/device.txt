the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .####O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O

if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .####O O O O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O B-NEG O
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
what kind of a company does that !####O O O O O O O O
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O

first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .####O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O

i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O
alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O B-NEG O O O O
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .####O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU I-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O
they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .####B-POS O O B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O

mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .####B-NEG I-NEG O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .####O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O
forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
they piggy-back on cingular 's service .####O O O O O O O
( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O

for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-POS O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O B-OP-0 O O O
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O
while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so why lie about it ?####O O O O O O
i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O

have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-POS O O O O O O
great ASPECT#1s , ASPECT#2s and white balance .####B-OP-1 O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O B-NEG I-NEG O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

either way , can 't go wrong with this price .####O O O O O O O O O O O

you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O
first let me give you the bad things :####O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
other than that this thing is great ...####O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )####O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O B-OP-1 B-POS B-OP--1 O O O O O
to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O
i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apex sucks !####O O O
i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well ASPECT#2s that can be learned quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
great screen and great sound .####B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP-1 B-POS O
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .####O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O
all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .####O O B-NEG O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .####O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O B-OP--1 O
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .####O O O B-POS I-POS I-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O
i love the eos based ASPECT#1s and easy ASPECT#2s .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O
for the price and features it is really good .####O O O O O O O O O O
and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O O O B-OP--1 O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one minor complaint :####O B-OP-0 O O
if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU I-NEU I-NEU O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 O B-NEU B-NEU O O O
the plus points are -####O O O O O
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O B-NEU B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
video output stopped workin .####O O O O O
the sound quality is very good .####O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O
depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-OP-0 O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP--1 O O O
otherwise , this player is awesome !####O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####O B-NEG I-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .####O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-1 O B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
made the camera totally inoperable .####O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O
i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !####O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
but , i would definately recommend this phone .####O O O O O O O O O
my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .####O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular ASPECT#2s .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .####O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG I-NEG O O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .####O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-POS O
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another stupid move .####O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O
what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O O O O
you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
awesome feature .####B-OP-1 B-POS O
well , not with this one .####O O O O O O O
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 it is very compact but the ASPECT#1s are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .####O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O
now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
way less expensive than the ipod .####O O O O O O O
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .####O O O O O O O O O O O
- well-backlit keypad####O O O
i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also covers over the power jack when closed .####O O O O O O O O O O
a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .####B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .####O B-NEG I-NEG I-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O
so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .####B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
but you do n't have to be .####O O O O O O O O
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O
sent mine back .####O O O O
i am really impressed by this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O
battery life is ok .####O O O O O
i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
i forgot , the case does n't fit .####O O O O O O O O O
it defaulted to unchangeable email .####O O O B-OP-0 O O
. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O
i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
however , i should have followed my instincts :####O O O O O O O O O
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !####O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound quality :####O B-POS O
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .####O O O B-OP-1 B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O
it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .####O O O O O O O O B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
overall design :####B-OP-0 O O
i am very pleased with it so far .####O O O O O O O O O
i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
one major complaint :####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS B-OP-1 O
there should have been a recall on this product .####O O O O O O O O O O
the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was able to take great ASPECT#1s of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing ASPECT#2s of the kids playing with sparklers .####O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great feature list , poor reliability .####B-OP-1 O B-POS O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .####O B-POS O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great buy .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O
if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the ASPECT#1s , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
creative software stinks .####B-OP-1 B-POS O O
subsequent behavior even worse .####B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-OP--1 O
stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .####O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG I-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O
it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
this dvd play is basicly junk .####O O O O O O O
no instructions .####O O O
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O
i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .####O B-OP-1 O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O

typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.####O O O O O O O
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 B-POS O
do n't buy this player .####O O O O O O
but that 's a moot point now .####O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O
i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O B-NEU O O O O
hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .####O O O O O O O O O O
the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O
third party software to the rescue####B-OP-0 O O O O O
if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real ASPECT#3.####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O

i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O

anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !####O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest ASPECT#1es that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O

the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .####O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .####O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .####O O B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O
that 's a rare and valuable feature .####O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 O O
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .####O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O

this seemed like a really good compromise .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
could not stop it , could not get out of the " now playing " screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .####O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O
i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had the player for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU I-NEU I-NEU O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very bad quality .####O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .####O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .####B-NEG O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O
( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O O O O O

depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .####B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O

5 hours max. i did it like this####O O O O O O O O
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more downside to this phone ?####O O O O O O
this thing seriously is a good player though .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O
i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
it did lock up on me a couple of times .####O O O O O O O O O O O
one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O
the battery recharges real fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O
strengths are well listed by other reviewers .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-NEU I-NEU O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS I-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 B-POS O O
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .####O O O O B-OP--1 O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .####O O O O O O O O O O O
and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?####O O O O O O O O O O O
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .####O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O
i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O
my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .####O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
* slick-looking design and improved interface####O O O O O O
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .####O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O
one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !####O O O O O O O O O O
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so what are you waiting for ?####O O O O O O O
3 battery has to be removed to recharge .####O O O O O O O O O
within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .####O O O O O O O O O O
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O B-POS O
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .####O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O B-OP-0 O O B-NEU O O O
those ASPECT#1d to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O

the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .####O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####O O B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O
even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O
i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one ASPECT#1. even though they were not damaged in any way .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they stop time .####O O O O
there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .####O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .####O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O
now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O
the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O B-POS O O O O
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-NEG I-NEG O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
i bought this dvd player in november .####O O O O O O O O
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .####O O O O B-NEG O O O O O O B-NEG O O O O B-OP--1 O
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O
i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
usb 2.0 - very fast####O O O O O
no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O B-POS I-POS O
i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a disappointment .####O O O O
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .####O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .####O O O O O O O O
amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O

but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i received this as a gift .####O O O O O O O
when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .####O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O
they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .####O O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O
well that is not true .####O O O O O O
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O

from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O B-POS O
and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i will not be ordering another one to replace it .####O O O O O O O O O O O

i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O
as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
takes excellent ASPECT#1s .####O B-OP-1 O O
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the money apex machines have good features .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .####O B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .####O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O
definetely a great camera .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .####O O O O O O O O
( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they take excellent macro shots as well .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .####B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP-1 O
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-POS B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS I-POS O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-POS I-POS I-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
whereas some folks have the " ipod " , i have the " nomad jukebox zen xtra " ( not to be confused with the " nomad jukebox zen nx " ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .####B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .####O O O O O O O O O O
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .####O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .####O O O O O O O O O
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .####O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.####O O O O B-POS I-POS O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more ASPECT#1s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that is where my satisfaction ends .####O O O O O O O
dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .####O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .####O O B-OP-0 B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS I-POS O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O
i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O
read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
here 's why :####O O O O
the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
third , the poor design continues with the case .####O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O
artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O
what the heck is up with the 2600 .####O O O O O O O O O
what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bait and switch .####O O O O
so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O
- some features in the user interface####O O O O O O O
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .####O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O
granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O O O O O O O O
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .####B-NEU O O B-OP-0 O O O O
this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !####O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
now i need to buy myself another one !####O O O O O O O O O
4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).####O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O
instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .####O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .####O O O O O O O O O O
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
simple to use and hook up .####O O O O O O O
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .####O O O B-NEU O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O
the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
this is pretty cool .####O O O O O
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing does its job .####O O O O O O
hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .####O O O O O O O O O O
no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG I-NEG O
it is great ASPECT#1ing , even with the supplied earbuds .####O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O
it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O
i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .####B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O B-OP--1 O O O O B-OP--1 O
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-POS I-POS O O O O O B-OP-1 O
after that it seems like you 're on your own .####O O O O O O O O O O O
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O B-POS O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
almost there .####O O O
after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .####O O O O O O O O B-NEU O O
only the cheap and poor would buy one .####O O O O O O O O O
canon have packed a lot in here and the ASPECT#1s and ASPECT#2s are easy to use and logically laid out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O
can 't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party ASPECT#2es , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-NEU O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O

when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
learning how to use it will not take very long .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am returning the broken one today .####O O O O O O O O
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .####O O O O O O O O O
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is good for a phone of this size .####B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O

i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP--1 B-NEG O
simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend buying one .####O O O O O O
i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

you 're talking totally different hardware .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the downside though , may be a big one for you .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .####O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times ASPECT#3s gets you just that much closer .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O

with canon , you get ASPECT#1s that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O
in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O

recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly ASPECT#3s are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O

8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper ASPECT#1s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .####O O O B-POS I-POS O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS I-POS O

in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i checked with nokia .####O O O O O
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , without further adoo .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
the dvd player does not work properly .####O O O O O O O O

so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O

nokia has definitely won me over with this one .####O O O O O O O O O O

i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the instruction manual is very bad .####O O O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O
yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU B-OP-0 O O B-OP-0 O O
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
and we all know about the rush to market on new products .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .####O O O O O O O O
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .####B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .####O O O O O O O B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
i have been assured this will be fixed soon .####O O O O O O O O O O

f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course####O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .####O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O

a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .####O O O O O O O O O O O
what is up .####O O O O
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O

not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .####O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O

it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .####O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .####O O O O O O O O
i guess that 's why you so often see " ipodders " bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole " i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better " thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O

since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

that is a major minus , but its not that bad .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O

to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press " menu " on the remote while the dvd is playing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bottom line :####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O

they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG I-NEG O O O O O B-NEG I-NEG B-OP--1 O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the reason it does not get 5 stars####O O O O O O O O
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O

like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O

3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my opinions :####O O O
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-1 O O O O B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O

am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !####O O O O O O O O O O O
still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .####B-NEU O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-NEG I-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .####O O O O O O O
took hundreds of ASPECT#1s and they were great .####O O O O O O O O O
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
no way to contact their customer service .####O O O O O O O O
i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only ASPECT#2ed less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
only one disk played through to completion successfully .####O O O O O O O O O
yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of ASPECT#2s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .####B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
it takes great ASPECT#1s .####O O O O O
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .####O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 has most if not all of the ASPECT#1s that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O
but the earbuds suck !####O O O O O
i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll just say this .. .####O O O O O O O
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .####O O B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O
these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .####O O O O B-OP-1 O B-NEU O B-OP-0 O O B-NEU O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason :####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
the case had ad2600 .####O O O O O
you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the downside -####O O O
now i can transport files to friends house with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .####O O O O B-OP-1 O O O B-POS I-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .####O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O
i like the default blue .####O O O O O O
hopefully you still have the remote control .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O O O O

what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the sound from the player is ok .####O O O O O O O O
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-ASPECT#3 player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .####O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O

this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O
following my research , i decided on the g3 .####O O O O O O O O O O
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

another plus in my book , no file limits !####O O O O O O O O O O

i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .####O B-POS O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP--1 O O

since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i bought this product from amazon .####O O O O O O O
by the way , it looks nice also .####O O O O O O O O O

well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .####O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 O O O O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O B-OP-1 O

4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .####O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O B-NEU I-NEU I-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O

some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .####O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-0 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O

with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .####O O O O O O O O O O O

no line out jack - as i said , there is none .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .####O B-POS O O B-POS O O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS I-POS O O O O O O
when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .####B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O B-NEU I-NEU O O B-OP-0 O O O B-NEU O
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .####O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O
the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-0 B-NEU O
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .####O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
i am very pleased so far .####O O O O O O O

i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
wo n't play a lot of discs .####O O O O O O O O
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many ASPECT#5s to adjust if you like .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .####B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-NEU O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 B-NEU B-POS O B-OP-0 O O B-NEU O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O

i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .####O O O O O O O O O
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .####O O O O O O O
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .####B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP-0 O O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O B-NEG O O O O O O B-OP--1 O
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .####O O O O O O O O O O O
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .####O O O B-NEU O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .####O O O O O O O O O O
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O

for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-NEU I-NEU I-NEU O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the ASPECT#2s are very easy to use and produce good results .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- outstanding signal reception####O B-OP-1 O B-POS
i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's easy .####O O O O
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-POS O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
the general button placement is not very user-friendly .####O O O O O O O O O
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile ASPECT#2s as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .####O O O O O O O B-NEU O O

without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .####O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O B-OP-1 B-NEU O O O

* price and capacity####O O O O
it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after " loading " for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated " no disk " .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O
some of the great gains over g2 --####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O
on an average , you would charge it once a week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
granted this is cheaper than an ipod .####O O O O O O O O
i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .####O O O O B-NEU B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .####O O O O O O O O O
it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was immediately interested in the 6610 .####O O O O O O O O
the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS I-POS O O O B-POS O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O B-POS O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-OP--1 B-POS B-NEG O O O O O

worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O

cheaper in every way .####O O O O O
the g2 was better in this respect .####O O O O O O O O
the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O
you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .####O O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 is loaded with many useful ASPECT#1s , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-1 O O O O B-OP-0 B-OP-1 B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O
and then it breaks .####O O O O O
i am not talking milliseconds .####O O O O O O
i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?####O B-OP-1 B-NEU I-NEU O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O B-POS O
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O
i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .####O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it worked good for a while .####O O O O O O O
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O

buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .####B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent ASPECT#2s that way if you wanted to .####O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life on this phone is surreal .####O B-POS I-POS O O O O B-OP-1 O
this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .####O O O B-NEU I-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O
some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;####O O O O O O O O O O
that player is a complete piece of sh ***.####O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O
those that have it like it .####O O O O O O O
i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NEU O B-NEU O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O
then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .####O O O O O O O O O O O
can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage####O O O B-NEG O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O O O O O O O O O O
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O
pros summary :####O O O
i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-POS O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .####O O O O O O O O O O
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !####O O O O O O O O O O
it can get pretty lonely out there .####O O O O O O O O
the ASPECT#1s are awesome .####O O O O O
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-POS O O O B-POS O O O
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .####O O O O O O O O O O
this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen has no stop button .####O O O O O O O
red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .####B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP-0 B-NEU O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has ASPECT#2s that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .####B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure enough there is no such ability .####O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
you need the software to actually transfer files####O O O O O O O O
i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU B-OP-1 O
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .####O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O
connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O
i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the quality of the pictures .####O O O O O O O O
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O
there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O
otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .####O O O O O O O O O O O
so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .####O O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O B-POS O
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O
i cancelled the order .####O O O O O
imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a big plus in my book .####O O O O O O O
so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O B-NEU O O O O O O
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but for what i do use it is perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O
this is not a player you can take jogging .####O O O O O O O O O O
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the ASPECT#1s are quite impressive .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-POS I-POS B-OP-1 O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O
but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .####O O O O O B-POS B-OP-1 O O O
it takes great ASPECT#1s , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't buy this thing .####O O O O O O
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .####O O O O O O O O O O
this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
i give it 10 stars !####O O O O O O
bought two ad2600 's for christmas .####O O O O O O O
i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !####O B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU I-NEU O O O O O O O
the software is great .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O
i purchased this player last week .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
10 great price for all the features .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !####B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O
since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the " duplicate name " problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O
you can always spend more money to get a better one .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O
yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .####O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .####B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O B-NEG O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O B-NEG O
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O
but canon never fails to amaze .####O O O O O O O
when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ASPECT#1s are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so what 's the problem ?####O O O O O O
despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you have to add all the songs to a play list .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had no problems following their installation instructions .####O O O O O O O O O
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O
their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .####O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O O O
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .####O B-POS I-POS O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
i liked this one enough to buy another .####O O O O O O O O O
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just make sure the keys are locked .####O O O O O O O O
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .####O O O O B-NEU I-NEU O B-OP-1 B-OP--1 B-NEG O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O
or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O B-OP-0 O
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .####O O O O O O O O O O
a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O
how does it sound ?####O O O O O
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .####O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O B-NEU O
i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .####O O O O O O O O O O O
negative points :####B-OP--1 B-NEG O
there is usb , though .####O O O O O O
transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .####B-POS I-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is made of plastic .####O O O O O O
hopefully you wo n't regret .####O O O O O O
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .####O O O O O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O
i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O
if you have a question , they have the answer .####O O O O O O O O O O O
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .####O B-OP-0 O B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .####O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O
oh my goodness --####O O O O
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .####O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O O O O
the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .####O O B-OP--1 O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O B-OP-1 O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .####O O O O O B-OP-1 O O O O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O O B-OP-1 O O B-POS O
do n't drop this unit :####O O O O O O
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-POS O B-OP-1 O O O O O O O O O
when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .####O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .####O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O
for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP-0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .####O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O B-OP-1 O B-POS O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O B-OP-0 B-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP--1 O O B-NEG I-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !####O O O O O O O O O O O
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..####O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .####O B-OP-1 B-POS O O O O O O O O B-OP-1 B-POS O B-OP--1 B-NEG O O O O O O
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
